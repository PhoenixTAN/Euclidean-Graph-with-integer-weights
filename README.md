# Euclidean-Graph-with-integer-weights
Yield a euclidean graph with all its weights which are integers. All vertices cannot be in one line.

Definition of Euclidean Graph:  
A Euclidean graph is a graph in which the vertices represent points in the plane,   
and the edges are assigned lengths equal to the Euclidean distance between those points.  

Example 1:  

(20, 16)  
(88, 67)  
(96, 73)  
(72, 55) 


distance:   
a-b: 85.0  
a-c: 95.0  
a-d: 65.0  
b-c: 10.0  
b-d: 20.0  
c-d :30.0
